## 📘 Overview  
The **Student Dropout Prediction System** is a machine-learning web application that predicts whether a student is at risk of dropping out, based on academic, financial, and behavioural data. It’s designed to help educational institutions take **data-driven actions** to improve student retention.

- Predicts dropout risk using **Random Forest Classifier** (or whichever model you’re using)  
- User-friendly web interface (e.g., built with Streamlit, Flask, or Django)  
- Interactive data visualisation dashboards  
- Upload CSV datasets for prediction + report feature importance / accuracy  
- Clear classification output: e.g., “At risk” vs “Not at risk”

## 🧩 Technologies Used  
- **Python 3.x**  
- `streamlit` (or `flask`/`django`, whichever you use)  
- `pandas`, `numpy` — for data processing  
- `scikit-learn` — for building the model  
- `plotly` or `matplotlib` — for visualisations
